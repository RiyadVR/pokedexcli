# üêæ My Awesome Pokedex! üêæ

Gotta catch 'em all! This is my super cool Pokedex, built with Go, where I can keep track of all the amazing Pok√©mon I've caught on my adventures.

## What can it do?

- **Map your journey!** Discover new locations with `map` (shows the next 20 areas) and revisit old paths with `mapb` (shows the previous 20 areas).
- **Explore new lands!** Venture into different areas to find wild Pok√©mon.
- **Catch 'em all!** Add new Pok√©mon to your collection.
- **Inspect your buddies!** Get details about the Pok√©mon you've successfully caught.
- **See your collection!** The `pokedex` command lets you proudly list all the Pok√©mon *you've personally caught* so far!

## How to use it?

Just run the program and type in these commands to start your adventure:

- `map` (see new areas!)
- `mapb` (go back to previous areas!)
- `explore [area_name]` (what's lurking there?)
- `catch [pokemon_name]` (try to snag a wild one!)
- `inspect [pokemon_name]` (check out your caught pals!)
- `pokedex` (show off your collection!)
- `help` (if you get lost or need a reminder!)
- `exit` (when you're done adventuring for the day!)

May your journey be filled with glorious catches and exciting discoveries! Happy training! ‚ú®
